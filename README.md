# DarkMode

This mod is a [Geode] port of old patch by [Absolute] made for [RedHuseey]'s [Dark Mode GD texture pack].

## But it has _settings_

Check out mod's settings, the default values are set to have same values as [Absolute]'s [DarkMode Patcher] patches.

## Disclaimer

It is not a texture pack. This mod only changes the colors that are not changeable via texture packs, helpful for "dark mode" texture packs.
