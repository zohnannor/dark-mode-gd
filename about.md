# DarkMode

This mod is a [Geode] port of old patch by [Absolute] made for [RedHuseey]'s [Dark Mode GD texture pack].

## But it has _settings_

Check out mod's settings, the default values are set to have same values as [Absolute]'s [DarkMode Patcher] patches.

### TODO:

-   ensure there is no crashes
-   compatibility with other mods
-   level name and description inputs backgrounds
-   level share description
-   level loading play button background
-   platformer controls settings background
-   lists progress bars
-   map packs progress bars
-   chest background
-   chest platforms (in the basement)
-   shop colors
-   gauntlet colors
-   leaderboard highlight color
-   "floating ui settings", a button on every screen for quick customization (for future me: `#include <Geode/ui/GeodeUI.hpp>`)

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, reach out on [Github] (open new issue) or [Discord] (`@zohnannor`)!

PRs are welcome!
